# deep-thoughts

Deep-Thoughts is a single-paage MERN social-media application. It uses React Router to make the application behave more like a multi-page application, allowing users to bookmark URLs and use the browser's forward and back buttons. It also includes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to provide all the data needed in a single string. JWTs also eliminate the need to save session IDs on teh back end and don't require as many server-side resources, and can be generated anywhere.
